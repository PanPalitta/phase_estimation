# Reinforcement learning algorithm for adaptive phase estimation

We implement reinforcement learning algorithm to the problem of adaptive phase estimation, which is an example of quantum control problems. The aim of this project is to create a library containing modules that streamlines the construction of an optimization algorithm for quantum control problems. Access to modules of optimization algorithms provides the building blocks that users can use to tweak the algorithm to their needs.

Features:

 * Library in C++
 * Support MPI
 * Support VSL and GPU for random number generation
 * Include modules for particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE)
 * Include uniform and clustered method of initializing solution candidates
 * Include access to user specified accept-reject criteria
 * Include preliminary support for multi-objective calculation
 * Support Autotools
